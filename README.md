# MALG Project Group 10

The goal of this project is to use proof tools such as TLA+ and Frama-C in order to prove some algorithm correctness.

## Studied algorithm

1. Floyd's triangle
2. Bubble Sort
3. Custom algorithm: p1

## Software:

- [TLA+](http://lamport.azurewebsites.net/tla/tla.html)
- [Frama-C](https://frama-c.com/)
